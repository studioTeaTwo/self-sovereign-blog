## Now on TESTNET

We took off from simnet and are in a global network.

It's a challege time!

All you need is to get the `preimage` of the invoice below and to input it in devtools. I assume you need to take some actions. Chop your own wood, and it will warm you twice.

Paths are made by walking.

- Prepare the wallet for the testnet

```
